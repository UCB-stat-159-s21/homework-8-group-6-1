[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/UCB-stat-159-s21/homework-8-group-6-1/HEAD)

## TO DO:
Update this README.md file with information about your package implementation in a similar way to how it is done in [this example](https://github.com/fperez/mytoy). You should include a Binder badge just like that example. You can use that README.md as a starting point if you wish. Your repo should include all of the infrastructure described in that file so that it meets Python packaging requirements.
